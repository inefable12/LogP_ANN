Bacterial substrate-binding proteins (SBPs) bind iron-siderophore complexes and deliver these complexes to ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters for import into the cytoplasm, where the iron can be transferred from the siderophore to catalytic enzymes. In Yersinia pestis, the causative agent of plague, the Yersinia iron-uptake (Yiu) ABC transporter has been shown to improve iron acquisition under iron-chelated conditions. The Yiu transporter has been proposed to be an iron-siderophore transporter; however, the precise siderophore substrate is unknown. Therefore, the precise role of the Yiu transporter in Y. pestis survival remains uncharacterized. To better understand the function of the Yiu transporter, the crystal structure of YiuA (YPO1310/y2875), an SBP which functions to present the iron-siderophore substrate to the transporter for import into the cytoplasm, was determined. The 2.20 and 1.77Å resolution X-ray crystal structures reveal a basic triad binding motif at the YiuA canonical substrate-binding site, indicative of a metal-chelate binding site. Structural alignment and computational docking studies support the function of YiuA in binding chelated metal. Additionally, YiuA contains two mobile helices, helix 5 and helix 10, that undergo 2-3Å shifts across crystal forms and demonstrate structural breathing of the c-clamp architecture. The flexibility in both c-clamp lobes suggest that YiuA substrate transfer resembles the Venus flytrap mechanism that has been proposed for other SBPs.YiuA, a Yersinia pestis substrate-binding protein, contains a putative basic triad binding motif in the canonical substrate-binding site, indicative of a metal-chelate complex binding site. Additional structural and simulation analyses support the putative function of YiuA binding bacterial siderophores. © Radka et al. 2017.","29095164","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85032743171"

Alternative treatment options such as vaccines tend to be most promising and cost effective approaches against this resistant pathogen. In the current study, we have explored the pan-genome of A. baumannii followed by immune-proteomics and reverse vaccinology approaches to identify potential core vaccine targets. Results: The pan-genome of all available A. baumannii strains (30 complete genomes) is estimated to contain 7,606 gene families and the core genome consists of 2,445 gene families (~32 % of the pan-genome). Phylogenetic tree, comparative genomic and proteomic analysis revealed both intra- and inter genomic similarities and evolutionary relationships. Among the conserved core genome, thirteen proteins, including P pilus assembly protein, pili assembly chaperone, AdeK, PonA, OmpA, general secretion pathway protein D, FhuE receptor, Type VI secretion system OmpA/MotB, TonB dependent siderophore receptor, general secretion pathway protein D, outer membrane protein, peptidoglycan associated lipoprotein and peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase are identified as highly antigenic. Epitope mapping of the target proteins revealed the presence of antigenic surface exposed 9-mer T-cell epitopes. Protein-protein interaction and functional annotation have shown their involvement in significant biological and molecular processes. The pipeline is validated by predicting already known immunogenic targets against Gram negative pathogen Helicobacter pylori as a positive control. Conclusion: The study, based upon combinatorial approach of pan-genomics, core genomics, proteomics and reverse vaccinology led us to find out potential vaccine candidates against A. baumannii. The comprehensive analysis of all the completely sequenced genomes revealed thirteen putative antigens which could elicit substantial immune response. The integration of computational vaccinology strategies would facilitate in tackling the rapid dissemination of resistant A.baumannii strains. The scarcity of effective antibiotics and the global expansion of sequencing data making this approach desirable in the development of effective vaccines against A. baumannii and other bacterial pathogens. © 2016 The Author(s).","27634541","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84987917097"

The Gram-positive pathogen Staphylococcus aureus is known to produce four siderophores for which genetic and/or structural data are unknown. Here we characterize the gene cluster responsible for producing the prevalent siderophore staphyloferrin A. In addition to expressing the cluster in the heterologous host Escherichia coli, which confers the ability to synthesize the siderophore, we reconstituted staphyloferrin A biosynthesis in vitro by expressing and purifying two key enzymes in the pathway. As with other polycarboxylate siderophores, staphyloferrin A is biosynthesized using the recently described nonribosomal peptide synthetase independent siderophore (NIS) biosynthetic pathway.

Besides its known high affinity to enterobactin, the most important siderophore, it has been recently shown that NGAL is able to bind Fe(III) coordinated by catechols. The selective binding of Fe(III)-catechol ligands to NGAL is here studied by using iron coordination structures with one, two, and three catecholate ligands. By means of a computational approach that consists of B3LYP/6-311G(d,p) quantum calculations for geometries, electron properties and electrostatic potentials of ligands, protein-ligand flexible docking calculations, analyses of protein-ligand interfaces, and Poisson-Boltzmann electrostatic potentials for proteins, we study the binding of iron catecholate ligands to NGAL as a central member of the lipocalin family of proteins. This approach provides a modeling basis for exploring in silico the selective binding of iron catecholates ligands giving a detailed picture of their interactions in terms of electrostatic effects and a network of hydrogen bonds in the protein binding pocket. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Scn-Ngal (also known as neutrophil gelatinase associated lipocalin, siderocalin, lipocalin 2) sequesters bacterial iron chelators, called siderophores, and consequently blocks bacterial growth. However, Scn-Ngal is also prominently expressed in aseptic diseases, implying that it binds additional ligands and serves additional functions. Using chemical screens, crystallography and fluorescence methods, we report that Scn-Ngal binds iron together with a small metabolic product called catechol. The formation of the complex blocked the reactivity of iron and permitted its transport once introduced into circulation in vivo. Scn-Ngal then recycled its iron in endosomes by a pH-sensitive mechanism. As catechols derive from bacterial and mammalian metabolism of dietary compounds, the Scn-Ngal-catechol-Fe(III) complex represents an unforeseen microbial-host interaction, which mimics Scn-Ngal-siderophore interactions but instead traffics iron in aseptic tissues. These results identify an endogenous siderophore, which may link the disparate roles of Scn-Ngal in different diseases. © 2010 Nature America, Inc.

The average Fe-O bond distances and bond angles are compared to those of known marine and terrestrial siderophores. From these two data sets, we then examined other known marine natural products (MNPs) that can form a hexavalent complex with six Fe-O bonds and draw conclusions about their potential biological role as marine siderophores. This computational data indicates that Fe(III) strongly bonds to a host of MNPs, increasing their water solubility, contracting their structure, hence allowing transport through cell membranes more readily, and in some cases, stabilizing ester bonds that are susceptible to hydrolysis. It is argued that administering medicinally bryostatin, its analogs or other MNPs as a ferric complex, holds some fundamental chemical advantages compared to its administration as a neutral uncomplexed species.","18404560","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-48149111999"

Salmonella vaccines are the most effective, however, producing a broad-spectrum vaccine remains challenging due to Salmonella’s many serotypes. Efforts are urgently required to develop a novel vaccine candidate that can tackle all S. Typhi strains because of their high resistance to multiple kinds of antibiotics (particularly the XDR H58 strain). In this work, we used a computational pangenome-based vaccine design technique on all available (n = 119) S. Typhi reference genomes and identified one TonB-dependent siderophore receptor (WP_001034967.1) as highly conserved and prospective vaccine candidates from the predicted core genome (n = 3,351). The applied pan-proteomics and Immunoinformatic approaches help in the identification of four epitopes that may trigger adequate host body immune responses. Furthermore, the proposed vaccine ensemble demonstrates a stable binding conformation with the examined immunological receptor (HLAs and TRL2/4) and has large interaction energy determined via molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulation techniques. Eventually, an expression vector for the Escherichia. coli K12 strain was constructed from the vaccine sequence. Additional analysis revealed that the vaccine may help to elicit strong immune responses for typhoid infections, however, experimental analysis is required to verify the vaccine’s effectiveness based on these results. Moreover, the applied computer-assisted vaccine design may considerably decrease vaccine development costs and speed up the process. The study’s findings are intriguing, but they must be evaluated in the experimental labs to confirm the developed vaccine’s biological efficiency against XDR S. Typhi. Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

This interaction of DFOB with Ti(IV) is investigated by using spectro-potentiometric and spectro-photometric titrations, mass spectrometry, isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), and computational modeling. The data from pH 2-10 suggest two one-proton equilibria among three species, with one species predominating below pH 3.5, a second from pH 3.5 to 8, and a third above pH 8. The latter species is prone to slow hydrolytic precipitation. Electrospray mass spectrometry allowed the detection of [Ti(IV) (HDFOB)]2+ and [Ti(DFOB)]+; these species were assigned as the pH < 3.5 and the 3.5 < pH < 8 species, respectively. The stability constant for Ti(IV)-DFOB was determined by using UV/vis-monitored competition with ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA). Taking into consideration the available binding constant of Ti(IV) and EDTA, the data reveal values of log β111 = 41.7, log β110 = 38.1, and log β11-1 = 30.1. The former value was supported by ITC, with the transfer of Ti(IV) from EDTA to DFOB determined to be both enthalpically and entropically favorable. Computational methods yielded a model of Ti-DFOB. The physiological and environmental implications of this tight interaction and the potential role of DFOB in solubilizing Ti(IV) are discussed. © 2017 American Chemical Society.","28118016","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85011985575"

The first chemical synthesis of SB is reported, which enables further molecular and biological characterization and provides access to structural analogues of the siderophore. Under conditions of iron limitation, addition of synthetic SB to bacterial growth medium recovered the growth of the antibiotic resistant community isolate S. aureus USA300 JE2. Two structural analogues of SB, epiSB and SBimide, were also synthesized and employed to investigate how epimerization of the citric acid moiety or imide formation influence its function as a siderophore. Epimerization of the citric acid stereocenter perturbed the iron-binding properties and siderophore function of SB as evidenced by experimental and computational modeling studies. Although epiSB provided growth recovery to S. aureus USA300 JE2 cultured in iron-deficient medium, the effect was attenuated relative to that of SB. Moreover, SB more effectively sequestered the Fe(III) bound to human holo-transferrin, an iron source of S. aureus, than epiSB. SBimide is an imide analogous to the imide forms of other citric acid siderophores that are often observed when these molecules are isolated from natural sources. Here, SBimide is shown to be unstable, converting to native SB at physiological pH. SB is considered to be a virulence factor of S. aureus, a pathogen that poses a particular threat to public health because of the number of drug-resistant strains emerging in hospital and community settings. Iron acquisition by S. aureus is important for its ability to colonize the human host and cause disease, and new chemical insights into the structure and function of SB will inform the search for new therapeutic strategies for combating S. aureus infections.

Herein, we evaluate the Ti(IV)-coordination chemistry of four catechol-based, hexacoordinate chelators using synthetic, structural, computational, and radiochemical approaches. The siderophore enterobactin (Ent) and its synthetic mimic TREN-CAM readily form mononuclear Ti(IV) species in aqueous solution at neutral pH. Radiolabeling studies reveal that Ent and TREN-CAM form mononuclear complexes with the short-lived, positron-emitting radionuclide 45Ti(IV), and do not transchelate to plasma proteins in vitro and exhibit rapid renal clearance in naïve mice. These features guide efforts to target the 45Ti isotope to prostate cancer tissue through the design, synthesis, and evaluation of Ent-DUPA, a small molecule conjugate composed of a prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA) targeting peptide and a monofunctionalized Ent scaffold. The [45Ti][Ti(Ent-DUPA)]2− complex forms readily at room temperature. In a tumor xenograft model in mice, selective tumor tissue accumulation (8±5 %, n=5), and low off-target uptake in other organs is observed. Overall, this work demonstrates targeted imaging with 45Ti(IV), provides a foundation for advancing the application of 45Ti in nuclear medicine, and reveals that Ent can be repurposed as a 45Ti-complexing cargo for targeted nuclear imaging applications. © 2024 Wiley-VCH GmbH.","38442302","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85188533232"

The technique allows the visualization of the spatial distribution of (bio)molecules from metabolites to proteins, on surfaces such as tissues sections or bacteria culture media. One particularly exciting example of MALDI-MSI use rests on its potential to localize ionized compounds produced during microbial interactions and chemical communication, offering a molecular snapshot of metabolomes at a given time. The huge size and the complexity of generated MSI data make the processing of the data challenging, which requires the use of computational methods. Despite recent advances, currently available commercial software relies mainly on statistical tools to identify patterns, similarities, and differences within data sets. However, grouping m/z values unique to a given data set according to microbiological contexts, such as coculture experiments, still requires tedious manual analysis. Here we propose a nontargeted method exploiting the differential signals between negative controls and tested experimental conditions, i.e., differential signal filtering (DSF), and a scoring of the ion images using image structure filtering (ISF) coupled with a fold change score between the controls and the conditions of interest. These methods were first applied to coculture experiments involving Escherichia coli and Streptomyces coelicolor, revealing specific MS signals during bacterial interaction. Two case studies were also investigated: (i) cellobiose-mediated induction for the pathogenicity of Streptomyces scabiei, the causative agent of common scab on root and tuber crops, and (ii) iron-repressed production of siderophores of S. scabiei. This report proposes guidelines for MALDI-MSI data treatment applied in the case of microbiology contexts, with enhanced ion peak annotation in specific culture conditions.

Such rapid growth requires ample access to nutrients, including iron. However, access to this critical metal is heavily restricted in mammals, which requires B. anthracis to employ petrobactin, an iron-scavenging small molecule known as a siderophore. Petrobactin biosynthesis is mediated by asb gene products, and import of the iron-bound (holo)-siderophore into the bacterium has been well studied. In contrast, little is known about the mechanism of petrobactin export following its production in B. anthracis cells. Using a combination of bioinformatics data, gene deletions, and laser ablation electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (LAESI-MS), we identified a resistance-nodulation-cell division (RND)-type transporter, termed ApeX, as a putative petrobactin exporter. Deletion of apeX abrogated export of intact petrobactin, which accumulated inside the cell. However, growth of ΔapeX mutants in iron-depleted medium was not affected, and virulence in mice was not attenuated. Instead, petrobactin components were determined to be exported through a different protein, which enables iron transport sufficient for growth, albeit with a slightly lower affinity for iron. This is the first report to identify a functional siderophore exporter in B. anthracis and the in vivo functionality of siderophore components. Moreover, this is the first application of LAESI-MS to sample a virulence factor/metabolite directly from bacterial culture media and cell pellets of a human pathogen.IMPORTANCE Bacillus anthracis requires iron for growth and employs the siderophore petrobactin to scavenge this trace metal during infections. While we understand much about petrobactin biosynthesis and ferric petrobactin import, how apo-petrobactin (iron free) is exported remains unknown. This study used a combination of bioinformatics, genetics, and mass spectrometry to identify the petrobactin exporter. After screening 17 mutants with mutations of candidate exporter genes, we identified the apo-petrobactin exporter (termed ApeX) as a member of the resistance-nodulation-cell division (RND) family of transporters. In the absence of ApeX, petrobactin accumulates inside the cell while continuing to export petrobactin components that are capable of transporting iron. Thus, the loss of ApeX does not affect the ability of B. anthracis to cause disease in mice. This has implications for treatment strategies designed to target and control pathogenicity of B. anthracis in humans. © 2017 Hagan et al.","28900020","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85033666240"

Burkholderia pseudomallei, the tier 1 agent of melioidosis, is a saprophytic microbe that causes endemic infections in tropical regions such as South-East Asia and Northern Australia. It is globally distributed, challenging to diagnose and treat, infectious by several routes including inhalation, and has potential for adversarial use. B. pseudomallei strain MSHR5848 produces two colony variants, smooth (S) and rough (R), which exhibit a divergent range of morphological, biochemical and metabolic phenotypes, and differ in macrophage and animal infectivity. We aimed to characterize two major phenotypic differences, analyse gene expression and study the regulatory basis of the variation. Methodology. Phenotypic expression was characterized by DNA and RNA sequencing, microscopy, and differential bacteriology. Regulatory genes were identified by cloning and bioinformatics. Results/Key findings. Whereas S produced larger quantities of extracellular DNA, R was upregulated in the production of a unique chromosome 1-encoded Siphoviridae-like bacteriophage,’MSHR5848. Exploratory transcriptional analyses revealed significant differences in variant expression of genes encoding siderophores, pili assembly, type VI secretion system cluster 4 (T6SS-4) proteins, several exopolysaccharides and secondary metabolites. A single 3 base duplication in S was the only difference that separated the variants genetically. It occurred upstream of a cluster of bacteriophage-associated genes on chromosome 2 that were upregulated in S. The first two genes were involved in regulating expression of the multiple phenotypes distinguishing S and R. Conclusion. Bacteriophage-associated proteins have a major role in the phenotypic expression of MSHR5848. The goals are to determine the regulatory basis of this phenotypic variation and its role in pathogenesis and environmental persistence of B. pseudomallei. © 2019, Microbiology Society.

The non-ribo-somal peptide ferribactin undergoes cyclizations and oxidations that result in the fluorophore, and a strictly conserved fluorophore-bound glutamic acid residue is converted to a range of variants, including succinamide, succinic acid, and -ketoglu-taric acid residues. We recently discovered that the pyridoxal phosphate-containing enzyme PvdN is responsible for the generation of the succinamide, which can be hydrolyzed to succinic acid. Based on this, a distinct unknown enzyme was postulated to be responsible for the conversion of the glutamic acid to -ke-toglutaric acid. Here we report the identification and characterization of this enzyme in P. fluorescens strain A506. In silico analyses indicated a periplasmic transaminase in fluorescent pseudomonads and other proteobacteria that we termed PtaA for “periplasmic transaminase A.” An in-frame-deleted ptaA mutant selectively lacked the -ketoglutaric acid form of pyoverdine, and recombinant PtaA complemented this phenotype. The ptaA/pvdN double mutant produced exclusively the glutamic acid form of pyoverdine. PtaA is homodimeric and contains a pyridoxal phosphate cofactor. Mutation of the active-site lysine abolished PtaA activity and affected folding as well as Tat-dependent transport of the enzyme. In pseudomonads, the occurrence of ptaA correlates with the occurrence of -ke-toglutaric acid forms of pyoverdines. As this enzyme is not restricted to pyoverdine-producing bacteria, its catalysis of periplasmic transaminations is most likely a general tool for specific biosynthetic pathways. © 2017 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.","28912270","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85033596257"

However, cobalamin can be synthesized only by few microorganisms so most bacteria need to take it up from the environment through the TonB-dependent transport system. The first stage of cobalamin import to E. coli cells occurs through the outer-membrane receptor called BtuB. Vitamin B12 binds with high affinity to the extracellular side of the BtuB protein. BtuB forms a β-barrel with inner luminal domain and extracellular loops. To mechanically allow for cobalamin passage, the luminal domain needs to partially unfold with the help of the inner-membrane TonB protein. However, the mechanism of cobalamin permeation is unknown. Using all-atom molecular dynamics, we simulated the transport of cobalamin through the BtuB receptor embedded in an asymmetric and heterogeneous E. coli outer-membrane. To enhance conformational sampling of the BtuB loops, we developed the Gaussian force-simulated annealing method (GF-SA) and coupled it with umbrella sampling. We found that cobalamin needs to rotate in order to permeate through BtuB. We showed that the mobility of BtuB extracellular loops is crucial for cobalamin binding and transport and resembles an induced-fit mechanism. Loop mobility depends not only on the position of cobalamin but also on the extension of luminal domain. We provided atomistic details of cobalamin transport through the BtuB receptor showing the essential role of the mobility of BtuB extracellular loops. A similar TonB-dependent transport system is used also by many other compounds, such as haem and siderophores, and importantly, can be hijacked by natural antibiotics. Our work could have implications for future delivery of antibiotics to bacteria using this transport system. Copyright: © 2020 Pieńko, Trylska.

Computational biology analysis of these genomes showed a high degree of identity/similarity among 16 proven or possible iron/heme transporters identified. Of these, 7 systems were essentially the same in all seven genomes analyzed. The remaining 9 loci had 2-6 genetic variations among these genomes.

UPEC harbors a host of virulence factors like curli, hemolysin, siderophore, and motility factors and can form biofilm-like communities and quiescent reservoirs that aid its survival. This study was performed to investigate the antibiofilm, antimicrobial, and antivirulence potentials of three chromone derivatives, namely, 6-bromo 3-formylchromone, 6-chloro 3-formylchromone, and 3-formyl 6-isopropylchromone.

Gene expression analysis indicated these three derivatives downregulated virulence genes associated with toxins, biofilm production, and stress regulation and suggested they might target two-component UvrY response regulator. 3D-QSAR analysis showed that substitutions at the third and sixth positions of the chromone scaffold favor antimicrobial activity against UPEC.

However, the design of porous solids with chemical stability still remains limited to carboxylate or azolate groups. There is a timely opportunity to develop new synthetic platforms that make use of unexplored metal binding groups to produce metal-linker joints with hydrolytic stability. Living organisms use siderophores (iron carriers in Greek) to effectively assimilate iron in soluble form. These compounds make use of hard oxo donors as hydroxamate or catecholate groups to coordinate metal Lewis acids such as iron, aluminum, or titanium to form metal complexes very stable in water. Inspired by the chemistry of these microorganisms, we report the first hydroxamate MOF prepared by direct synthesis. MUV-11 (MUV = materials of Universidad de Valencia) is a crystalline, porous material (close to 800 m2·g-1) that combines photoactivity with good chemical stability in acid conditions. By using a high-throughput approach, we also demonstrate that this new chemistry is compatible with the formation of single-crystalline phases for multiple titanium salts, thus expanding the scope of accessible precursors. Titanium frameworks are regarded as promising materials for photocatalytic applications. Our photoelectrochemical and catalytic tests suggest important differences for MUV-11. Compared to other Ti-MOFs, changes in the photoelectrochemical and photocatalytic activity have been rationalized with computational modeling, revealing how the chemistry of siderophores can introduce changes to the electronic structure of the frontier orbitals, relevant to the photocatalytic activity of these solids.

Pyoverdines (PVDs) are high affinity siderophores, for which the molecular mechanisms of biosynthesis, uptake and regulation have been extensively studied in Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1. However, the extent to which this regulatory model applies to other pseudomonads is unknown. Here, we describe the results of a genomic, genetic and structural analysis of pyoverdine-mediated iron uptake by the plant growth-promoting bacterium P. fluorescens SBW25. Results. In silico analysis of the complete, but un-annotated, SBW25 genome sequence identified 31 genes putatively involved in PVD biosynthesis, transport or regulation, which are distributed across seven different regions of the genome. PVD gene iron-responsiveness was tested using 'lacZ fusions to five PVD loci, representative of structural and regulatory genes. Transcription of all fusions increased in response to iron starvation. In silico analyses suggested that regulation of fpvR (which is predicted to encode a cytoplasmic membrane-spanning anti-sigma factor) may be unique. Transcriptional assays using gene expression constructs showed that fpvR is positively regulated by FpvI (an extracytoplasmic family (ECF) sigma factor), and not directly by the ferric uptake regulator (Fur) as for PAO1. Deletion of pvdL, encoding a predicted non-ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) involved in PVD chromophore biosynthesis confirmed the necessity of PvdL for PVD production and for normal growth in iron-limited media. Structural analysis of the SBW25 PVD shows a partly cyclic seven residue peptide backbone, identical to that of P. fluorescens ATCC13525. At least 24 putative siderophore receptor genes are present in the SBW25 genome enabling the bacterium to utilize 19 structurally distinct PVDs from 25 different Pseudomonas isolates. Conclusion. The genome of P. fluorescens SBW25 contains an extensively dispersed set of PVD genes in comparison to other sequenced Pseudomonas strains. The PAO1 PVD regulatory model, which involves a branched Fpv signaling pathway, is generally conserved in SBW25, however there is a significant difference in fpvR regulation. SBW25 produces PVD with a partly cyclic seven amino acid residue backbone, and is able to utilize a wide variety of exogenous PVDs. © 2008 Moon et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","18194565","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-38949166058"

Our search identified 15 NRPS sequences, among which two were found to be closely related to peptide synthetases of various fungi taking part in ferrichrome biosynthesis. Another peptide synthetase gene was similar to that identified in Aspergillus oryzae which is possibly responsible for the biosynthesis of fusarinine, an extracellular iron-chelating siderophore. To our knowledge, this is the first report on the identification of a putative NRPS gene possibly responsible for the biosynthesis of fusarinine-type siderophores.

Since 1970 a large number of siderophores have been characterized, the majority using hydroxamate or catecholate as functional groups. The biosynthesis of siderophores is typically regulated by the iron levels of the environment where the organism is located. Because of their exclusive affinity and specificity for iron(III), natural siderophores and their synthetic derivatives have been exploited in the treatment of human iron-overload diseases, as both diagnostic and therapeutic agents. Here, solid-phase approach for the preparation of hexadentate, peptide-based tricatecholato containing peptides is described. The versatility of the synthetic method allows for the design of a common scaffolding structure whereby diverse ligands can be conjugated. With so many possibilities, a computational approach has been developed which will facilitate the identification of those peptides which are capable of providing a high affinity iron(III) binding site. This study reports an integrated computational/synthetic approach towards a rational development of peptide-based siderophores. © 2020 by the authors.

The use of bioinformatic tools to interpret the instructions encoded in microbial biosynthetic genes has the potential to circumvent the existing methodological bottlenecks and greatly expand the scope of discovery. Structural prediction algorithms for nonribosomal peptides (NRPs), the largest family of microbial natural products, lie at the heart of this new approach. To understand the scope and limitation of the existing prediction algorithms, we evaluated their performances on NRP synthetase biosynthetic gene clusters. Our systematic analysis shows that the NRP biosynthetic landscape is uneven. Phenylglycine and its derivatives as a group of NRP building blocks (BBs), for example, have been oversampled, reflecting an extensive historical interest in the glycopeptide antibiotics family. In contrast, the benzoyl BB, including 2,3-dihydroxybenzoate (DHB), has been the most underexplored, hinting at the possibility of a reservoir of as yet unknown DHB containing NRPs with functional roles other than a siderophore. Our results also suggest that there is still vast unexplored biosynthetic diversity in nature, and the analysis presented herein shall help guide and strategize future natural product discovery campaigns.

Beside iron starvation, the ability to produce siderophores depends upon several other factors. Chemical structure of siderophore is very complex with vast structural diversity, thus the principle challenge involves its detection, quantification, purification and characterisation. Metal chelation is its most fascinating attribute. This metal chelation property is now forming the basis of its application as molecular markers, siderotyping tool for taxonomic clarification, biosensors and bioremediation agents. This has led researchers to develop and continuously modify previous techniques in order to provide accurate and reproducible methods of studying siderophores. Knowledge obtained via computational approaches provides a new horizon in the field of siderophore biosynthetic gene clusters and their interaction with various proteins/peptides.

To facilitate the acquisition of Cu ions, some methanotrophic bacteria secrete small modified peptides known as “methanobactins,” which strongly bind Cu and function as an extracellular Cu recruitment relay, analogous to siderophores and Fe. In addition to Cu, methanobactins form complexes with other late transition metals, including the Group 12 transition metals Zn, Cd, and Hg, although the interplay among solution-phase configurations, metal interactions, and the spectroscopic signatures of methanobactin-metal complexes remains ambiguous. In this study, the complexation of Zn, Cd, and Hg by methanobactin from Methylocystis sp. strain SB2 was studied using a combination of absorbance, fluorescence, extended x-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectroscopy, and time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) calculations. We report changes in sample absorbance and fluorescence spectral dynamics, which occur on a wide range of experimental timescales and characterize a clear stoichiometric complexation dependence. Mercury L3-edge EXAFS and TD-DFT calculations suggest a linear model for Hg[sbnd]S coordination, and TD-DFT suggests a tetrahedral model for Zn2+ and Cd2+. We observed an enhancement in the fluorescence of methanobactin upon interaction with transition metals and propose a mechanism of complexation-hindered isomerization drawing inspiration from the wild-type Green Fluorescent Protein active site. Collectively, our results represent the first combined computational and experimental spectroscopy study of methanobactins and shed new light on molecular interactions and dynamics that characterize complexes of methanobactins with Group 12 transition metals. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.","34271330","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85109606623"

The Escherichia coli catecholate siderophore enterobactin is synthesized in the cytoplasm upon iron starvation. Seven enzymes are required for enterobactin biosynthesis: EntA-F, H. Given that EntB-EntE and EntA-EntE interactions have been reported, we investigated a possible EntA-EntB-EntE interaction in E. coli cells. We subcloned the E. coli entA and entB genes into bacterial adenylate cylase two-hybrid (BACTH) vectors allowing for co-expression of EntA and EntB with N-terminal fusions to the adenylate cyclase fragments T18 or T25. BACTH constructs were functionally validated using the CAS assay and growth studies. Co-transformants expressing T18/T25-EntA and T25/T18-EntB exhibited positive two-hybrid signals indicative of an intracellular EntA-EntB interaction. To gain further insights into the interaction interface, we performed computational docking in which an experimentally validated EntA-EntE model was docked to the EntB crystal structure. The resulting model of the EntA-EntB-EntE ternary complex predicted that the IC domain of EntB forms direct contacts with both EntA and EntE. BACTH constructs that expressed the isolated EntB IC domain fused to T18/T25 were prepared in order to investigate interactions with T25/T18-EntA and T25/T18-EntE. CAS assays and growth studies demonstrated that T25-IC co-expressed with the EntB ArCP domain could complement the E. coli entB− phenotype. In agreement with the ternary complex model, BACTH assays demonstrated that the EntB IC domain interacts with both EntA and EntE. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.","27470582","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84979735991"

Bacteria secrete siderophores in order to sequester iron(III) from the surrounding medium by binding the essential metal with high affinity. Gallium, on the other hand, is an ""abiogenic"" ion, known for its anticancer, antibacterial, and anti-inflammatory action. The rationale behind its therapeutic effect lies in its close mimicry of the ferric ion. Since both ions share various physicochemical characteristics, it is of particular interest to understand if gallium could compete with the native ferric ion for binding siderophores and to decipher which molecular characteristics favor Ga3+ binding over Fe3+ binding. It is also well-known that some bacteria are susceptible to gallium-based therapy, while others are not. Therefore, many questions arise such as the following: (1) Which main group/groups building the siderophores promote gallium's attack? (2) Does the combination of the building blocks affect the preference toward a metal? (3) Does the environment play a crucial role? (4) Could the pH of the medium influence the balance between the ions? We try to address these questions by evaluating the free energy of the competition between Ga3+ and Fe3+ ions for siderophore ligands of various structures, denticities, and charge states by employing the tools of the computational chemistry at the DFT/SMD level. Our results not only fall in line with recent experimental data but also complement our knowledge about ""Trojan horse"" gallium-based therapy.

As a fundamental player in iron acquisition, MbtI promotes the survival and pathogenicity of Mtb in the infected host. Hence, it has emerged in the last decade as an innovative, potential target for the anti-virulence therapy of tuberculosis. In this context, 5-phenylfuran-2-carboxylic acids have been identified as potent MbtI inhibitors. The first co-crystal structure of MbtI in complex with a member of this class was described in 2020, showing the enzyme adopting an open configuration. Due to the high mobility of the loop adjacent to the binding pocket, large portions of the amino acid chain were not defined in the electron density map, hindering computational efforts aimed at structure-driven ligand optimization. Herein, we report a new, high-resolution co-crystal structure of MbtI with a furan-based derivative, in which the closed configuration of the enzyme allowed tracing the entirety of the active site pocket in the presence of the bound inhibitor. Moreover, we describe a new crystal structure of MbtI in open conformation and in complex with the known inhibitor methyl-AMT, suggesting that in vitro potency is not related to the observed enzyme conformation.

Inhibitors of aryl acid adenylating enzyme known as MbtA, involved in siderophore biosynthesis in Mycobacterium tuberculosis, are being explored as potential antitubercular agents. The ability to identify fragments that interact with a biological target is a key step in fragment based drug design (FBDD). To expand the boundaries of quantitative structure activity relationship (QSAR) paradigm, we have proposed a Fragment Based QSAR methodology, referred here in as FB-QSAR, for deciphering the structural requirements of a series of nucleoside bisubstrate analogs for inhibition of MbtA, a key enzyme involved in siderophore biosynthetic pathway. For the development of FB-QSAR models, statistical techniques such as stepwise multiple linear regression (SMLR), genetic function approximation (GFA) and GFAspline were used. The predictive ability of the generated models was validated using different statistical metrics, and similarity-based coverage estimation was carried out to define applicability boundaries. To aid the creation of novel antituberculosis compounds, a bioisosteric database was enumerated using the combichem approach endorsed mining in a lead-like chemical space. The generated library was screened using an integrated in-silico approach and potential hits identified. Copyright © 2011 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

The screened B-and T-cell epitopes were joined with each other via specific linkers and linked to the cholera toxin B subunit as an adjuvant to enhance vaccine immune protection efficacy. The designed vaccine construct induced cellular and humoral immune responses. Blind docking with immune cell receptors, followed by molecular dynamic simulation results confirms the good binding potency and stability of the vaccine in providing protection against the pathogen. © 2022 by the authors.

Expression of crp increases during pneumonic plague as the pathogen depletes glucose and forms large biofilms within lungs. To better understand control of Y. pestis Crp, we determined a 1.8-Å crystal structure of the protein-cAMP complex. We found that compared to Escherichia coli Crp, C helix amino acid substitutions in Y. pestis Crp did not impact the cAMP dependency of Crp to bind DNA promoters. To investigate Y. pestis Crp-regulated genes during plague pneumonia, we performed RNA sequencing on both wild-type and Δcrp mutant bacteria growing in planktonic and biofilm states in minimal media with glucose or glycerol. Y. pestis Crp was found to dramatically alter expression of hundreds of genes in a manner dependent upon carbon source and growth state. Gel shift assays confirmed direct regulation of the malT and ptsG promoters, and Crp was then linked to Y. pestis growth on maltose as a sole carbon source. Iron regulation genes ybtA and fyuA were found to be indirectly regulated by Crp. A new connection between carbon source and quorum sensing was revealed as Crp was found to regulate production of acyl-homoserine lactones (AHLs) through direct and indirect regulation of genes for AHL synthetases and receptors. AHLs were subsequently identified in the lungs of Y. pestisinfected mice when crp expression was highest in Y. pestis biofilms. Thus, in addition to the well-studied pla gene, other Crp-regulated genes likely have important functions during plague infection. IMPORTANCE Bacterial pathogens have evolved extensive signaling pathways to translate environmental signals into changes in gene expression. While Crp has long been appreciated for its role in regulating metabolism of carbon sources in many bacterial species, transcriptional profiling has revealed that this protein regulates many other aspects of bacterial physiology. The plague pathogen Y. pestis requires this global regulator to survive in blood, skin, and lungs. During disease progression, this organism adapts to changes within these niches. In addition to regulating genes for metabolism of nonglucose sugars, we found that Crp regulates genes for virulence, metal acquisition, and quorum sensing by direct or indirect mechanisms. Thus, this single transcriptional regulator, which responds to changes in available carbon sources, can regulate multiple critical behaviors for causing disease. © 2019 Ritzert et al.","31744922","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85075324621"

In an effort to improve the bioavailability, we have designed four conformationally constrained analogues of Sal-AMS that remove two rotatable bonds and the ionized sulfamate group on the basis of computational and structural studies. Herein we describe the synthesis, biochemical, and microbiological evaluation of chromone-, quinolone-, and benzoxazinone-3- sulfonamide derivatives of Sal-AMS. We developed new chemistry to assemble these three heterocycles from common β-ketosulfonamide intermediates. The synthesis of the chromone- and quinolone-3-sulfonamide intermediates features formylation of a β-ketosulfonamide employing dimethylformamide dimethyl acetal to afford an enaminone that can react intramolecularly with a phenol or intermolecularly with a primary amine via addition-elimination reaction(s). The benzoxazinone-3-sulfonamide was prepared by nitrosation of a β-ketosulfonamide followed by intramolecular nucleophilic aromatic substitution. Mitsunobu coupling of these bicyclic sulfonamides with a protected adenosine derivative followed by global deprotection provides a concise synthesis of the respective inhibitors. © 2013 American Chemical Society.","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84881234135"

Structures of siderophores produced by bacterial endophytes have not yet been elucidated. The aim of this work was to identify and characterize the siderophores produced by this bacterium. In a screening for mutants unable to produce siderophores we found a mutant that had a transposon insertion in a non-ribosomal peptide synthase (NRPS) gene coding for a putative siderophore biosynthetic enzyme. The chemical structure of the siderophore was predicted using computational genomic tools. The predicted structure was confirmed by chemical analysis. We found that siderophores produced by H.seropedicae Z67 are a suite of amphiphilic lipopeptides, named serobactin A, B and C, which vary by the length of the fatty acid chain. We also demonstrated the biological activity of serobactins as nutritional iron sources for H.seropedicae. These are the first structurally described siderophores produced by endophytic bacteria.
